# motor-controller
The purpose of this project was to test and develop a closed-loop motor system that used a tachnogenerator to provide feedback. Once the open-loop transfer function of the entire system was approximated, both uncompensated and compensated digital systems were designed in MATLAB to allow the user to control the motor setpoint and see the measured RPM. The response characteristics of each system were recorded and compared to demonstrate the benefits of PI compensation.
